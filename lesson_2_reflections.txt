What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you run git init the command will create a .git with metadata
that will record the changes you make to the files.
You have to add files that need tracking with git add then start commits !

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

the staging area is an anti chamber to the commit. It's where you place files that are ready to be commited
It's useful as a review panel before making changes. So each time you finish something and you're ready
for a commit you add it to the staging area. You can then go on with your work once you finished
to change everything you can review and choose if you think it's logical to place all those files in
the same commit or if some are missing. You can then go on and commit.
