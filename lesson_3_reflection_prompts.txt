When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you work with a team and need to share the project with others. When you want a sort of foolproof backup of 
your project because it's kept on Github's servers. When you change computers a lot and can't have your work "physically"

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If someone is commiting changes with bugs and they automatically transfer to you while you're either working on changes yourself
you might en up with bugs. You you have control on what goes in your computer or else it'd be easy to infect someone's computer.
